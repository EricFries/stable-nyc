# Stable Nyc

## Description

The rent stabilization status of a New York City residence building can be hard to determine. The data is public, but only in the form of five separate PDF files on the [New York Rent Guidelines Board site](http://nycrgb.org/html/resources/zip.html).

To make this data more accessible, [Stable.nyc](www.stable.nyc) allows NYC tenants search their building and easily find out if it is subject to stabilization policies. After checking the site's database, users can determine which borough office they need to contact to learn more about their housing rights.


## Background

Eric Fries and Rebecca Eakins created a Sinatra version of this project as part of their work in [The Flatiron School](http://flatironschool.com/web)'s web immersive program. Now, we're bringing you the Ruby on Rails version and deploying it to production.

## Features

- Relational database
- PDF parsing executibles in the lib
- Google Maps API integration

## Usage

To use the app, simply enter your address in the search bar and see if NYC rent stabilization policies apply to your building.

## Future

- Deploy to production
